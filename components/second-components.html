													<div class="modal-body">
														Hanz and Franz began as a practice in manipulating the DOM, or specifically a progress bar.

														Once I had the simple JavaScript code written for a one player game, I decided to take it to the next level by including an additional player. <br> Each player has two attack modes and two defenses. Later I decided the second player shouldn't have to control the defensive moves. So I wrote a random function that has two defenses and two non-reactive responses. Depending on the attack and defense, the health of the players varies.<br> I began with simple alerts. Unsatisfied with this solution, I designed a vintage sideshow with two humorous fighters.<br> At first I researched sprites. Once I had several put together and included in my game, I realized I didn't like the way they worked or looked. So I did more research and learned to create giffs. Then I simply had to figure out how to get a gif to work "once" on command. That turned out to be pretty difficult. I finally figured out how to replace the gif with a png each time an attack was triggered. Then I had to set a delay so that defense didn't happen at the exact same time. The delays also caused a problem. Mainly if you push the button too fast. <br> Honestly the whole game is campy and glitchy, so I decided it was ok for my first game.<br>Also, at this point I had already designed the game for a medium to large screen. As I began carefully placing each of the 10 giffs and pngs, I realized the game was not going to be responsive for other devices. That was unfortunate, but it was also one of my first projects, so I decided to leave it. <br> Well, I hope you enjoy Hanz and Franz. My favorite giff is when Franz is knocked-out.

														This began as a simple javascript calculator. <br>
														I wanted a drop-down menu where you could choose the type of conversion, instead of input fields and buttons.
														Once I had accomplished that, we were already working in UI-Router and creating to-do lists. <br>
														It seemed like it would be good practice to create several routes, controllers, and to-do lists. Once I had a theme, I decided to include the calculator as part of the app.<br>
														I spent many hours making the images pixal perfect. I included scroll-bars that started and stopped on exact points! (Later I would learn to use 'position absolute' with percentages. So, this is not a mobile friendly design.) But I am very proud of it! I believe it is beautiful!

														It might be obvious how much love went into this app. <br>
														I found an amazing creative team I wanted to apply too, so I decided to create a resume that would showcase my creativity and versatility. 
														I designed every image to be beautuful, a little whimsical, yet slightly dark. I didn't want it to be too cute, but I wanted to create a stage ready to employ characters later. <br>
														<br>This project has paralax, Angular components, themed pages, gifs, CSS animations and transition, some jQuery, bootstrap, and much more! I really wanted to dive into CSS. This app is scalable and responsive! I watched many tutorials and read a lot of blogs in order to come away with this variety of amazing animations. Although, I felt like maybe this site highlighted CSS a little better than it packaged myself and my skill set. So I decided to start a new resume site. But I love what is going on here, and plan to create a character that can be showcased in this environment.<br>
														I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
